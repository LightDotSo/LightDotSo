## 0xSequence

First and firstmost this project woudln't have been possible without 0xSequence's [wallet-contracts](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts) and the invention of the [Light State Sync](https://sequence.xyz/blog/sequence-wallet-light-state-sync-full-merkle-wallets) technology. Our multi-sig 4337 wallet contract implementation is entirely based on it.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the Ethereum community!

Our rewrite implementation of [go-sequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence) in rust is [here](./crates/sequence/).
