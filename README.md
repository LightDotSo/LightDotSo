## A friendly, 100% open-source, cross-chain smart wallet.

![](./assets/github.png)

- Same address, one wallet, all chains.
- Use any supported EVM chain under the same wallet configuration without ever worrying about having to bridge or refuel gas.
- Our aim is to reduce fragmentation and abstract away the complexity of interacting with multiple EVM chains for the end user so that it is easy and intuitive as possible.
