# LightDotSo

A 100% open-source, cross-chain multi-sig.

Same address, one wallet, all chains.

Use any supported EVM chain under the same wallet configuration without ever worrying about having to bridge or refuel gas.

Out aim is to reduce fragmentation and abstract away the complexity of interacting with multiple EVM chains for the end user so that it is easy and intuitive as possible.
