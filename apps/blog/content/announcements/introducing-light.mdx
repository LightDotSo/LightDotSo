# Introducing Light: a new approach to tackle EVM UX fragmentation.

Light enables users to seamlessly interact with any EVM chain (including L2, L3s) as if you're using one single network. 

The goal is to make using Ethereum a smooth experience everywhere.

More chains, more problems

It's increasingly becoming painful to have to bridge/refuel to use a new chain. Bridging takes you out of the flow, it's slow and cumbersome. And it's only going to get worse as the number of L2/L3s increase.

Here's some things Light can do right now:

### 1. Network abstraction

Light enables you to instantly interact across chains seamlessly, and pay gas in ANY asset you hold across chains.

Here's a quick demo: Sending USDC on Arbitrum & Optimism, while paying gas w/ USDT on Polygon, all in one transaction.

### 2. Cross-chain asset management

When using Gnosis Safe, you typically have to create a new wallet for each chain, resulting in different addresses.

With Light, you can create a single smart wallet w/ the same address across all chains, it all just "works".

### 3. Batch tx execution

Transfer or move any number of assets, regardless of chain, simultaneously all in one go.

Send your tokens & NFTs in any underlying chain with a single signature that works across chains.

<Image className="rounded-md" src="https://assets.light.so/blog/announcements/integrated-tech-stack.png" alt="Introducing Light"  width={1200} height={630} />

We've built a fully integrated tech stack to provide the best cross-chain experience for the end user, aligning w/ open standards like 4337 and 7579.

The aim is for anyone to spin up support for any new chain in seconds soon.

And it's all built fully through open source.
