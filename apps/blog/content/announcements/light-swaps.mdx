# Introducing Light Swaps

Light Swaps is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Light Protocol.

It is the first product built on the Light Protocol and a DEX aggregator that supports all ERC20 tokens on all chains.

It is currently in beta and is available on 30+ chains.

## How it works

We combine the best of bridging and solver based approaches to provide a fast, permissionless, and atomic way to swap tokens across chains.
Not only that, but through our [Timelock Balance](https://light.so/docs/timelock-balance) feature, we provide a way for users to escrow funds while preserving self-custodial security and off-chain solver rules are enforced on-chain and orchestrated through [Light Layer's Programmable Intents](https://paper.light.so/light-programmable-intents).
This way, we preserve the best of both worlds while providing a seamless user experience, and also enforcing security on-chain.

## Pros and Cons of Bridging vs Solver Based Approaches

### Bridging Based Approaches

#### Pros

- Permissionless, enforced on-chain
- Mature and battle-tested, widest range of tokens and chains
- Enshrined bridges can be the most gas efficient + fast + secure

#### Cons

- Take time and is fragile
- Need destination gas for transactions to initiate on target chain(s)
- Not atomic, if the transaction fails on the target chain, the swap will fail

### Solver Based Approaches

#### Pros

- No gas needed for transactions to initiate
- Atomic execution on target chain(s)
- Fast, can be instant if the funds are fronted immediately

#### Cons

- Counterparty risk
- Not enforced on-chain, price is not guaranteed
- CAB balances are not self-custodial and can be seized by the solver/operator

### Using Light Protocol

### Pros

- No gas needed for transactions on any chain(s) w/ any asset(s)
- CAB balances are self-custodial, and can be repaid/withdrawn if solver/operator fails to perform through insurance
- Solver/operator operations are programatically defined and can be enforced on-chain through programmable intents

### Use Cases

- If the destination chain is not specified, Light Swaps will automatically route to provide the best price benefeting users w/ the best price execution

## How to use Light Swaps

Light Swaps is currently in beta and is available on all chains supported by the Light Protocol.
To use Light Swaps, you can go to [https://light.so/swap](https://light.so/swap) and connect your wallet.
You will need to deposit funds into your Light Wallet and approve the swap amount. (This will change soon, read more below)
