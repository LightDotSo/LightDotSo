# Introducing Light: a new approach to tackle EVM UX fragmentation.

Fragmentation of UX is one of the biggest problems that crypto faces right now

In the future, I believe users will interact with crypto through intents to achieve any desired outcome with a single click abstracting away all complexity

Here's the specs:

### 1. Light Architecture

At the core of the protocol is the Light Layer - a "thin" layer designed to facilitate cross-chain transactions for achieving any desired outcome: automatically routing authorized assets/transactions filled by off-chain actors guaranteeing the best execution on the user's behalf.

It sits a layer below other interoperability protocols and facilitates user-defined intents / solver-filled transactions so that the friction is invisible, and is responsible for clearing and settlement of off-chain actors beneath.


### 2. Intents

Not all intents are equal.

There are different granularity of intents (from generalized to RFQs), and not all are executable by off-chain actors, and can be asynchronous or conditional.

Therefore, there needs to be a different authorization flows depending on each use case.

The end goal is to be holistic and not be opinionated in any way, supporting all tx formats and arbitrary function calls across chains - through "programmatic atomicity", it achieves each execution step while ensuring the necessary authorization of assets or conditions are met.

However, realistically speaking, this is extremely hard to achieve user adoption - from a client / interface-side perspective, most wallets right now require multiple prompts for signing N signatures or authorizations.

This is a bottleneck for adoption for any kind of generalized system, as there will likely to be little order-flow for such a new and different approach - the current authorization flow is not fit to the current standards meaning high cost of barrier.

### 3. Light Layer

Light aims to overcome this through aiming for an "end-to-end" solution where we provide a full stack "chain abstraction" experience and GTM w/ flagship products + distribute modular SDKs in order to achieve an ideal seamless experience for the end user for a unified experience.

At the end of the day, users want convenience and usability -  I believe there to be an "invisible" middleware that automatically facilitates cross-domain txs - the "Visa" of crypto, where authorization is specialized, but settlement is routed through for any desired execution
