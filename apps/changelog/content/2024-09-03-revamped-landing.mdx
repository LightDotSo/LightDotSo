We've completely revamped the landing page to make it more interactive and up-to-date.
This will be the showcase for all the new features we're building, specially for our upcoming launch.
Stay tuned for more updates on our [X](https://x.com/LightDotSo) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/lightdotso).

## Demo Walkthrough

We've added a new section to explore all the new features we're building.
This will be all interactive and you'll be able to directly interact with the features through a [demo](https://light.so/demo).
A walkthrough is important in our belief to show how easy it is to use Light and explore crypto through our app.

## What's next?

We're always looking for ways to improve the landing page.
If you have any ideas, please share them with us on [X](https://x.com/LightDotSo).
Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for our users using Ethereum and all chains.
