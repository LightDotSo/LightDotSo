# Speed Optimizations

We've made a number of optimizations to improve the speed of Light.

### Faster page loads

Now, when you visit Light, the page loads in less than 80% of the time it used to.
For comparison, the initial size JS bundle is now up to 10% of the size it used to be.
Stay tuned for [a post on our blog](https://light.so/blog) going into more detail on some of these optimizations.

### Faster image loading

We've also made a number of optimizations to improve the speed of image loading using [Cloudflare Image Optimization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/cloudflare-images/).

## What's next?

We're always looking for ways to improve the speed of Light.
If you have any ideas, please share them with us on [X](https://x.com/LightDotSo).
Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for our users using Ethereum and all chains.
