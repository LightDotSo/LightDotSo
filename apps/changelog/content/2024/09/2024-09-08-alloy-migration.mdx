We've migrated to [`alloy-rs`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core) from [`ethers`](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) for our rust codebase.

See this [migration PR](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2296) for more details.

This is a part of our initiative to move away from `ethers` and towards `alloy-rs` for all our rust codebases, and will help us push more features and improvements benefiting from the latest rust x solidity tooling and language features.
