We've upgraded to [`tokio` suite](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) (`axum`, `tower`, `hyper`, etc.) successfully.

See this [upgrade PR](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2351) for more details.

This is a part of our initiative to keep the core dependencies updated to the latest versions and improve the security and performance of the platform.

Running the following [command](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14178) to upgrade the dependencies with breaking changes:

```sh
cargo +nightly update --breaking -Z unstable-options
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
