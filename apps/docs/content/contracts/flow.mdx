# Flow

### Deposit

User deposits the following information to the timelock contract.
Note that the user does not need to specify a specific operation hash, as the filler will generate a new one for each execution.

```solidity
struct Deposit(
    address inputToken;
    uint256 inputAmount;
    address userOpSender;
)
```

### Execution 

The execution is the process of transferring the funds from the filler to the user.
This is done by the filler, which is the account that is receiving the funds from the user on origin chain(s).
Since called by the account, this event is emitted by the account itself (intended for when the execution is atomic and the prior operations are successful).

```solidity
struct Execution(
    address fillerRecipient;
    bytes32 userOpHash;
)
```

### Execution Intent

The execution intent is the intent to execute a user operation.
Execution intents are different in the sense that they are emitted by the filler when not able to guarantee the atomicity of the user operation.

```solidity
struct ExecutionIntent(
    address fillerRecipient;
    bytes32 userOpHash;
)
```

### Withdrawal

Users can request a withdrawal of their deposit at any time through our API.
The withdrawal request is verified a proposer and then proposed to the timelock contract.

### Withdrawal Request

```solidity
struct WithdrawalRequest(
    address inputToken;
    uint256 inputAmount;
)
```
