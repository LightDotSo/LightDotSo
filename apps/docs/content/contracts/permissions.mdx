## Specs 


### If "Protocol Owned Custody" (2/2 multi-sig)

- Vault shares are approved to the protocol controller
- The protocol controller is the operator for the vault
- Tokens are approved to the protocol controller

- Approval/Operator is set to an arbitrary vault controller
(it can move your assets anytime through a timelock)

- Fronted funds will default set the approval to the controller

ex: lwETH on base + optimism to lwETH on arbitrum
-> First, users will deposit to the vault in exchange for lwETH through the timelock on both base/optimism that will get used for "credits"
-> Then, the users will request to spend the lwETH on arbitrum through the paymaster
-> The paymaster will send the ETH to the vault controller if there is enough balance in which the controller will then send the ETH to the user

### If "Assisted Custody" (sub-account w/ cold storage + multi-plexer)



#### Why does it have to be a timelock as the chain abstraction operator?

- Exit mechanism 
- Have sufficient approval controls for the protocol to exit

## Premise

For the funds to be utilized for chain abstraction, it needs to be 

- The owner needs to be the timelock
- The vault needs to be custodied + authorized to the protocol controller for "credits"
- The protocol controller needs to be the operator for the vault
