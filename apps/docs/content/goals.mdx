The Light Protocol aims to provide a secure and efficient way to manage digital assets on multiple chains. 

- It will not enforce where all chain abstracted balance(s) are held by external custodians, but rather can be controlled based on the user's choice.

- The DAG functionality also welcomes enshrined in-protocol bridges which is future proof. (heavily underrated)

- Chain abstracted balances can be directly read on-chain as opposed to a centralized API endpoint, making way for composability.
