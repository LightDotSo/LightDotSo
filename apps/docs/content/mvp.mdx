## MVP Specification

The MVP is the first implementation of the Light Protocol.
It is a minimalistic version of the protocol that is designed to be simple and easy to understand.
The MVP is intended to be a starting point for further development and refinement of the protocol.

### MVP Features

- **Experience**: The MVP is designed to provide the best possible chain abstraction experience.
- **Fast**: The MVP is designed to be fast and work well showcasing the potential of the protocol.
- **Flexibility**: The MVP is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy integration with existing interoperability solutions.

### MVP Don'ts

- **Complexity**: The MVP is intentionally simple and does not include all the features that will be present in the final version of the protocol.
- **Decentralization**: The MVP is not designed to be fully decentralized, but rather to provide a starting point for further development in this area.
- **Finality**: The MVP does not include finality guarantees, but rather focuses on providing a fast and efficient chain abstraction experience.
