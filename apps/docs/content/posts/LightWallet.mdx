## LightWallet

LightWallet is a simple account abstraction contract

```solidity
address owner
```

The owner of this account

_The owner is the EOA that is the owner of this account_

### onlyOwner

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner()
```

### entryPoint

```solidity
function entryPoint() public view virtual returns (contract IEntryPoint)
```

return the entryPoint used by this account.
subclass should return the current entryPoint used by this account.

### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IEntryPoint _anEntryPoint) public
```

_Should be set to the address of the EntryPoint contract
The official EntryPoint contract is at https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ff137d4b0fdcd49dca30c7cf57e578a026d2789_

#### Parameters

| Name           | Type                 | Description                             |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| \_anEntryPoint | contract IEntryPoint | The address of the entrypoint contract. |

### \_onlyOwner

```solidity
function _onlyOwner() internal view
```

Check if the caller is the owner

### execute

```solidity
function execute(address dest, uint256 value, bytes func) external
```

Executes a transaction (called directly from owner, or by entryPoint)

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description                                  |
| ----- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| dest  | address | The address of the target contract to call.  |
| value | uint256 |                                              |
| func  | bytes   | The calldata to send to the target contract. |

### executeBatch

```solidity
function executeBatch(address[] dest, bytes[] func) external
```

Executes a sequence of transactions (called directly from owner, or by entryPoint)

#### Parameters

| Name | Type      | Description                                           |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| dest | address[] | The array of address of the target contract to call.  |
| func | bytes[]   | The array of calldata to send to the target contract. |

### isValidSignature

```solidity
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes signature) external view returns (bytes4 magicValue)
```

Check if a signature is valid based on the owner's address
Comaptible with ERC1271

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type    | Description                         |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| hash      | bytes32 | The hash of the user operation      |
| signature | bytes   | The signature of the user operation |

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address anOwner) public virtual
```

The \_entryPoint member is immutable, to reduce gas consumption. To upgrade EntryPoint,
a new implementation of SimpleAccount must be deployed with the new EntryPoint address, then upgrading
the implementation by calling `upgradeTo()`

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type    | Description                              |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| anOwner | address | The address of the owner of this account |

### \_initialize

```solidity
function _initialize(address anOwner) internal virtual
```

Sets the owner of this account, and emits an event

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type    | Description                              |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| anOwner | address | The address of the owner of this account |

### \_requireFromEntryPointOrOwner

```solidity
function _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner() internal view
```

Require the function call went through EntryPoint or owner

### \_validateSignature

```solidity
function _validateSignature(struct UserOperation userOp, bytes32 userOpHash) internal virtual returns (uint256 validationData)
```

validate the signature is valid for this message.

#### Parameters

| Name       | Type                 | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userOp     | struct UserOperation | validate the userOp.signature field                                                                                 |
| userOpHash | bytes32              | convenient field: the hash of the request, to check the signature against (also hashes the entrypoint and chain id) |

### \_call

```solidity
function _call(address target, uint256 value, bytes data) internal
```

Executes a call to a target contract with specified value and data.

_This internal function uses the `call` function to make an external call to the target contract
with the specified value and data. It captures the success status and returned data of the call.
If the call is not successful, it reverts the transaction and provides the error message from the target contract._

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Description                                          |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| target | address | The address of the target contract to call.          |
| value  | uint256 | The amount of Wei (ETH) to send along with the call. |
| data   | bytes   | The data payload to send along with the call.        |

### getDeposit

```solidity
function getDeposit() public view returns (uint256)
```

check current account deposit in the entryPoint

### addDeposit

```solidity
function addDeposit() public payable
```

deposit more funds for this account in the entryPoint

### withdrawDepositTo

```solidity
function withdrawDepositTo(address payable withdrawAddress, uint256 amount) public
```

Withdraws value from the account's deposit

#### Parameters

| Name            | Type            | Description       |

### \_authorizeUpgrade

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal view
```

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}
```
