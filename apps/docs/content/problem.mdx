title: The Problem
description: The problem that Light Protocol solves
---

As the crypto ecosystem has grown exponentially, fragmentation has become a core issue - leading to interoperability between different chains becoming increasingly apparent. However, existing interoperability solutions generally have their own advantages and disadvantages, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Light Protocol aims to tackle this problem through a middleware-based approach that allows users to programmatically configure their desired behavior.

### What users want

Users just want to use all chains as if it's one, without the hassle of managing multiple chains (bridging, gas fees, etc).
This means that users want:

- Cross-chain transactions are atomic w/o failure
- Users' assets are secure and accessible
- Low friction and low cost with fast and secure transactions

### With Light Protocol

Light Protocol aims to provide a middleware layer that allows users to configure their desired behavior for cross-chain interactions. This includes:

- Atomic cross-chain transactions through intents/commitments
- Secure and accessible user assets through trusted timelock contracts
- Lower costs benefiting from economics of scale and netted settlement

### Current Intent Based Systems' Limitations

Currently, intent based systems are 1to1, meaning that there can be only one origin and destination chain for a single bridge transaction.
This not only lacks flexibility and is not scalable in a world with thousands of chains, where complex transactions may span multiple hops, and thus require a new bridge for each pair. Moreover, it becomes impossible for a single entity to verify all of the deposit transactions due to the large number of chains and the computational expense + chain finality differences.
