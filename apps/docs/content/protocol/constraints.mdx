## Constraints for using the Light Protocol

### Full Self Custody

- The chain agnostic operations (can be verified using `LightDAG` contract) must adhere to the protocol specs for successful orchestration.
- Can control or direct the flow of funds towards Assisted Custody or Protocol Owned Custody.
- There are no additional security constraints for the user.

### Assisted Self Custody

- Can act as the global `deposit` and `withdraw` for chain abstracted operations for full self custodial wallets. (gas + balances)
- For the funds to be fronted, the user must have approved the `LightTimelockController` to pull their tokens to the `Verifier` contract or address.
- The additional constraints is that there exists the `LightProtocolController` for execution of the operations, but not the proposals.

### Protocol Owned Custody

- Acts as the global `balance` using `ERC7540` compatible vaults and shares. (Shares or protocol owned permissions will be required for fronting)
- If using the deposited funds in the `LightVault` for funds fronting, the fronted funds will be debted, but has the option to be also protocol controlled if the user wants to.
- The funds are fully custodied by the protocol, and the user must adhere to protocol specs for successful exit of the funds.
