## Roles

### Solver (Filler)

- Must have _sufficient_ escrowed funds for the right to solve the operation (authorized by the verifier for rights to escrow)
- Trusts each verifier to transfer funds to the solver for repayment, and fees are received through the vault's funds, which are authorized by the verifier (operator)
- Rebalancing is not needed

### Vault (LP)

- ERC4626 (ERC7540 Vaults) that can escrow funds to a permitted verifier
- Anyone can asynchronously deposit and withdraw to the vault in exchange for shares
- Shares can be freely bought and sold, operator authorizes individual verifiers to lend funds for expectation for fees to be paid to the LPs

### Verifier (Settlement)

- Individually settled by addresses/contracts pertaining to the verifier
- Verifier is responsible for directly transferring funds to the solver for repayment/disputes (asynchronously or not, completely dependent on verifier logic)
- When borrowing funds, verifier is responsible for authorizing/transferring the funds to the solver for fulfillment

### Timelock (Escrow)

- Users deposit funds into the vault where it's "assisted self-custody" meaning only users can propose transfers/withdrawals
- Having a timelock means that users have an "on-chain" balance of the chain abstracted funds
- Commonly controlled by a cross-chain smart wallet (such as LightWallet) for easier management and control
