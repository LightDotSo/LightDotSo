# Goals

## Maximum Flexibility

- Intents filling is only one part of the puzzle of cross-chain operations, enshrined bridges will become more commonplace for say transfers between rollups and rollup clusters.

## Self Custody

- Users are not locked in to one solution, they can choose out of any of the approaches for chain abstraction for self custody (Complete self custody, Self custody, Assisted self custody, and Protocol owned custody)
