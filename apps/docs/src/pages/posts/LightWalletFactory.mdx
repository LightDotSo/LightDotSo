## LightWalletFactory

A factory contract for `LightWallet`

_A UserOperations "initCode" holds the address of the factory, and a method call (to createAccount, in this sample factory).
The factory's createAccount returns the target account address even if it is already installed.
This way, the entryPoint.getSenderAddress() can be called either before or after the account is created._

### accountImplementation

```solidity
contract LightWallet accountImplementation
```

Gets the address of the account implementation contract

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IEntryPoint _entryPoint) public
```

### createAccount

```solidity
function createAccount(address owner, uint256 salt) public returns (contract LightWallet ret)
```

Creates an account, and return its address.

_Note that during UserOperation execution, this method is called only if the account is not deployed.
This method returns an existing account address so that entryPoint.getSenderAddress() would work even after account creation_

### getAddress

```solidity
function getAddress(address owner, uint256 salt) public view returns (address)
```

calculate the counterfactual address of this account as it would be returned by createAccount()
