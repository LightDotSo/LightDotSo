:::tip[Gas Abstraction]
Gas Abstraction is a general term for abstracting away the complexity of gas management in blockchain networks.
Dealing with gas gets increasingly complex as the number of chains grow for the end user.
A network of solvers that powers a gas abstraction layer can help users interact with multiple chains without friction.
