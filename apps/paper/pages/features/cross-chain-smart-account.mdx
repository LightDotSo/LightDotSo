:::tip[Cross-chain Smart Account]
A cross-chain smart account is a versatile smart contract capable of operating across numerous chains, effectively functioning as a single wallet.
It streamlines asset management on different chains and facilitates the initiation of cross-chain transactions.
Our smart account framework is further equipped to support [signature aggregation](/features/signature-aggregation), allowing a single signature to initiate a batch of multiple transactions.
