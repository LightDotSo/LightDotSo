:::tip[Cross-chain Smart Account]
A cross-chain smart account is a smart contract that can interact across multiple chains, acting as a single wallet.
It can be used to manage assets on different chains, and can also be used to trigger cross-chain transactions.
Our smart account implementation also support [signature aggregation](/features/signature-aggregation), enabling single signature that can batch execute multiple transactions.
