:::tip[Gas Abstraction]
Gas Abstraction simplifies the complexity of managing gas across various blockchain networks.
As users engage with an increasing number of chains, managing gas can become a significant challenge.
Lights network of solvers provides a layer of gas abstraction, allowing for seamless interaction with multiple chains, minimizing complexity and friction for the user.
