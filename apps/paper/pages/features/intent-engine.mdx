:::tip[Intent Engine]
Intent Engine is a powerful feature in Light that enables users to define and execute cross-chain intents.
Users can define intents that can be executed across multiple networks, and in any granularity that will be processed by the Intent Engine.
Further integrates with routing towards OFA and other off-chain services.
