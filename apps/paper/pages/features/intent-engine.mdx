:::tip[Intent Engine]
The Intent Engine is a key component of Lightthat facilitates the definition and execution of cross-chain intents by users.
It allows users to specify intents with precise granularity, which the Intent Engine processes for execution across multiple networks.
Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with OFA routing and other off-chain services.
