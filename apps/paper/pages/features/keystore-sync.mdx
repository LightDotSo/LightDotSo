# Keystore Sync in Light

:::tip[Keystore Sync]
Keystore Sync enables seamless synchronization of keystore wallets across chains.
This enables users to freely switch between chains without having to manually upgrade their wallets for each chain.
Through seamless synchronization, there will ideally be minimum security implications for using wallets across chains with a single address.
