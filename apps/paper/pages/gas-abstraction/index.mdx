# Light Gas Abstraction

Light Gas Abstraction is a permissioinless, solver based solver network that provides universal gas abstraction for users of any compatible EVM network.

:::info
Initially, the solver network will be gated by a whitelist of approved solvers. Over time, the network will transition to a fully permissionless model.

## Architecture

Similar to intent-based architecture pioneered by [Across](https://across.to), Light Gas Abstraction is designed for the gas relayers to bear the capital risk associated w/ the gas abstraction.
