## What is the Light Layer in it's simplest form?

It's a “thin”, layer in which we programmatically facilitate cross-chain transactions based on the user's intent.

The corresponding conditions of the execution of the transactions can be decided by the user - since cross-chain transactions are inherently asynchronous, we take a more holistic approach where users can define the preferences, conditions, execution needed for cross-chain transactions.

In essence, it's a base layer where users submit transaction data w/ preferences, and mainly off chain entities fulfill execution and chains are abstracted away for any cross chain transaction or arbitrary function call across all EVM chains.

## What is the difference between existing interoperability solutions and the Light Layer?

Current interoperability solutions all have rough edges for example below:

ex: Intent based bridges like Across require substantial amount of liquidity, message basing bridges are costly and time consuming, shared sequencing layers are not in production (yet).

Rather than being constrained to one specific solution, Light sits below all of the interoperability protocols and acts as a “thin layer” to facilitate the cross-chain transactions for the user to get the desired outcome.

## What can fundamentally be achieved with Light Layer?

Since users can define their own preferences, conditions, and execution mechanisms based on their desired outcome, Light Layer can be used to achieve the following:

- **Force Inclusion**:
  Light Layer can be used to force inclusion of transactions on the underlying chains, by providing the necessary conditions and preferences for the transaction to be included in the block.
- **Asynchronous Cross-Chain Transactions**:
  Light Layer can be used to facilitate asynchronous cross-chain transactions, such as conditional transactions, recurring transactions, or any other form of arbitrary function call on the underlying chains.
- **Programmable Atomicity**:
  Light Layer can be used to achieve "Programmable Atomicity", where users can define their own execution, security, and settlement mechanisms based on their preferences, and the desired outcome can be achieved within the confines of the preferences.
