## What is the Light Layer in it's simplest form?

The Light Layer is a "thin" layer designed to programmatically facilitate cross-chain transactions based on user intents.
Users can specify the conditions and execution requirements for their transactions, taking advantage of the inherently asynchronous nature of cross-chain interactions.
Essentially, it acts as a foundational layer where users submit transaction data with preferences, while off-chain entities execute these transactions, abstracting away the complexities of cross-chain interactions across all EVM chains.

## What is the difference between existing interoperability solutions and the Light Layer?

Current interoperability solutions often face challenges, such as the high liquidity demands of intent-based bridges like Across, the cost and delays associated with message-based bridges, and the nascent stage of shared sequencing layers not yet in production.
Light Layer distinguishes itself by operating beneath these protocols as a "thin layer," enhancing user experience by seamlessly facilitating cross-chain transactions to achieve desired outcomes without being bound to a single solution.

## What can fundamentally be achieved with Light Layer?

The Light Layer enables several powerful functionalities:

- **Force Inclusion**:
  It ensures the inclusion of transactions on underlying chains by adhering to specified conditions and preferences.
- **Asynchronous Cross-Chain Transactions**:
  It supports complex transactions like conditional or recurring transactions and other arbitrary function calls on the underlying chains.
- **Programmable Atomicity**:
  Users can tailor their own execution, security, and settlement mechanisms to fit their preferences, achieving the desired outcomes within the specified framework.
