# The Endgame

## What would the endgame look like?

The endgame for Light would be for the user to set a preference, and automatically route corresponding transactions across different networks based on the user's intent.
If the contents of the transaction(s) is financially sensitive, the user would be able to set preferences for the transaction(s) to be routed across a network that is most secure, or most private, or most censorship-resistant, etc.
Where the contents of the transaction(s) is not financially valuable, the user should be able to process the transaction instantly and at the lowest cost.

## No Design Constraints

### Intent Graphs

Users are able to define complex intent graphs, where the outcome of one intent triggers another intent, and so on, until the desired outcome is achieved.
This can be conflicting intents, where the user sets a preference for the transaction to be routed across a network that gets the best pricing, and another preference for the transaction to be routed across a network that is most secure withing the underlying ecosystem.

### Parallel Transactions

Users are able to set preferences for parallel transactions, where the user sets a preference for the transaction to be routed across multiple networks at the same time.
Since the transactions are independent of each other, achieving execution on one network does not affect the execution on another network.

### Private Conditional Orders

Users are able to set conditional orders that are private, and only executed when certain conditions are met.
This can be used for trading, where the user sets a preference for the trade to be executed when the price of an asset reaches a certain level, or when the price of an asset reaches a certain level on another network.
