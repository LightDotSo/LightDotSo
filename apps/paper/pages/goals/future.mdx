# The Future

## What does the future of Lightlook like?

The future for Lightis to enable users to set preferences that automatically route transactions across different networks based on their intents.
For transactions with financially sensitive content, users could specify preferences for routing through the most secure, private, or censorship-resistant networks.
Conversely, for less financially critical transactions, the system would prioritize instant processing and cost efficiency.

## No Design Constraints

### Intent Graphs

Users can construct complex intent graphs where the outcome of one intent triggers another, continuing until the desired outcome is reached.
This could include conflicting intents, such as routing transactions through the network and offering the best pricing while also prioritizing the most secure network within the ecosystem.

### Parallel Transactions

Users can configure preferences for parallel transactions to be routed across multiple networks simultaneously.
As these transactions are independent, successful execution on one network does not impact another, ensuring robust and efficient processing.

### Private Conditional Orders

Lightenables users to set private conditional orders that execute only when specific conditions are met.
This feature is particularly useful in trading scenarios, such as executing a trade when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level or matches a price on another network.
