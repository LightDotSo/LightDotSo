# Goals

## What's the goal of Light?

The goal for Light to enable interacting across different EVM chains with little to no friction as possible,
while still posing no restrictions or counterparty risk for the user.

Users should only know that they are using Ethereum, and not have to bear the burden from the complexities of interacting with multiple chains.

## How does Light achieve this?

Light achieves this through a combination of smart contracts, relayers, and a specific middleware to enable programmatic cross-chain execution.
See [our products](/introduction/products) and [user flow](/introduction/user-flow) for how Light achieves this.
{/* See [Light Architecture](/architecture) and [Products](/products) for more details. */}

Through Light, users can authorize a batch of transactions with one signature, and the transactions are executed concurrently on the target chain(s) through a smart account.

To put it simply, Light makes it possible for users to interact with all EVM chains as one.
