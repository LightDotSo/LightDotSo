# Goals

## What's the goal of Light?

The goal for Light to enable interacting across different EVM chains with little to no friction as possible,
while still posing no restrictions or counterparty risk for the user.

Users should only know that they are using Ethereum, and not have to bear the burden from the complexities of interacting with multiple chains.

Use Ethereum as One.

## How does Light achieve this?

Light achieves this through a combination of smart contracts, relayers, and a specific middleware to enable programmatic cross-chain execution.
See [our products](/introduction/products) for how Light achieves this.
{/* See [Light Architecture](./architecture) and [Products](./products) for more details. */}

The main flow for users interacting with Light is as follows:

1. Users submits an intent/transaction to Light's offchain relayer

2. The relayer bids for the right to subsidize the transaction on the target chain(s)

3a. Users signs one signature to authorize the transaction on the target chain(s)

3b. (Optionally) User can set specific intent/preferences for the transaction to be executed on the target chain(s)

4. The corresponding transactions are relayed to the target chain(s) and executed concurrently through the bundler from a smart account

5. If a specific intent/preferences is set, the transactions are submitted to the target chain(s) at the specified order

Through Light, users can authorize a batch of transactions with one signature, and the transactions are executed concurrently on the target chain(s) through a smart account.

To put it simply, Light makes it possible for users to interact with all EVM chains at once.

## Main metrics we're aiming for

What are some of the main metrics we're aiming for with Light?

- Minimize the number of clicks + signatues

Users should not have to sign multiple transactions to interact across multiple chains. (And also switch networks + wait for confirmations in between)

- One time interaction

Users should not have to wait for confirmations on multiple chains to interact across chains, rather sign a batch of transaction once and have them executed programatically in the specified intent.

- No counterparty risk

Users should not have to delegate trust and bear risks to third party entities to interact across chains, such as approving a third party bridge contract for token allowances.
