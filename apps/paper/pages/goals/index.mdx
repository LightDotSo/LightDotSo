# Goals

## Purpose of Light

Lights fundamental aim is to streamline the user's experience across different EVM chains, minimizing friction and eliminating counterparty risks.
The vision is clear: users should perceive their actions as simply using Ethereum, unencumbered by the complexities that typically arise from navigating multiple chains.

## Realizing the Vision

Lightrealizes this vision through an innovative fusion of smart contracts, relayer networks, and specialized middleware crafted for programmatic cross-chain execution.
For a detailed account of how Lightachieves this, explore [our products](/introduction/products) and [user flow](/introduction/user-flow) sections.

With Light a user can initiate a batch of transactions with a single signature. These transactions are then executed simultaneously on the designated chain(s) using a smart account.

Lightredefines multiple EVM chain interactions, unifying them seamlessly as one.
