# Target Metrics

## Efficiency in User Actions

We aim to minimize user actions, specifically clicks and signatures.
Users should not need to sign multiple transactions or switch between networks and wait for confirmations when interacting across multiple chains.

## Single Interaction

Users can sign a batch of transactions at once, which are then executed programmatically according to the specified intent, eliminating the need to wait for confirmations from multiple chains.

## Unrestricted Design

It is vital that users face no restrictions or limitations in their cross-chain interactions.
The user experience should mirror the simplicity and familiarity of interacting within a single chain.

## Minimized Counterparty Risk

Reducing reliance on third parties is crucial.
Users should not have to delegate trust or assume risks by depending on external entities, like approving a third-party bridge contract for token allowances, to interact across chains.
