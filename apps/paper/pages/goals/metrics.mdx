# Target Metrics

What are some of the main metrics we're targeting for with Light?

## Minimize the number of clicks + signatures

Users should not have to sign multiple transactions to interact across multiple chains. (And also switch networks + wait for confirmations in between)

## One time interaction

Users should not have to wait for confirmations on multiple chains to interact across chains, rather sign a batch of transaction at once, and have them executed programmatically in the specified intent.

## No restrictions

Users should not have the restrictions of limitations with regards to cross-chain interaction, the design space should be as similar to as interacting with one.

## Minimal counterparty risk

Users should not have to delegate trust and bear risks to third party entities to interact across chains, such as approving a third party bridge contract for token allowances.
