# Chain Abstraction

## What is Chain Abstraction?

The concept of chain abstraction is to provider users a way to interact with multiple networks without complexity any friction.
The end goal is for users to not recognize that they are under the hood interacting with a blockchain(s).

## EVM Chain Abstraction

EVM Chain Abstraction is a subset of Chain Abstraction that focuses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based networks.

## Light's Approach

We believe that as of right now, the best way to approach Chain Abstraction is through a VM based approach.
This means that we will solely be focusing on the EVM networks. See the [comparison](/introduction/comparison) for more information.
