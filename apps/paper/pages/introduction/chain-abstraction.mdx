# Chain Abstraction

## What is Chain Abstraction?

The concept of chain abstraction is to provide users a way to interact with multiple networks without complexity and less friction as possible.
The end goal is for users to seamlessly .

## EVM Chain Abstraction

EVM Chain Abstraction is a subset of Chain Abstraction that focuses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based networks.

## Light's Approach

We believe that as of right now, the best way to approach Chain Abstraction is through a VM based approach due to some [known limitations](/glossary/limitations).
This means that we will solely be focusing on chain abstraction across EVM networks.
See the [comparison](/introduction/comparison) for more information.
