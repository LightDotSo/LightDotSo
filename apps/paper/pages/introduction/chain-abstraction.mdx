# Chain Abstraction

## What is Chain Abstraction?

The concept of chain abstraction is to provide users a way to interact with multiple networks without complexity and less friction as possible.
The end goal is for users to seamlessly interact with multiple chains under the hood without having to worry about the underlying network.

## What does it enable?

Chain Abstraction enables dApps to implement logic across multiple chains.
This innovation eliminates the necessity for users to toggle between networks, authenticate transactions on various chains, or incur gas fees on alternate chains.
Users can now effortlessly engage with your dApp across any supported chain, utilizing any token, all while staying within your user interface.

## EVM Chain Abstraction

:::warning
Light is currently focusing on EVM Chain Abstraction.
:::

EVM Chain Abstraction is a subset of Chain Abstraction that focuses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based networks.
This means that the networks that are supported are those that are EVM compatible, not limited to Ethereum itself.
However, this means that non-EVM networks are not supported like Bitcoin, Solana, etc.

## Light's Approach

We believe that as of right now, the best way to approach Chain Abstraction is through a VM based approach due to some [known limitations](/glossary/limitations).
This means that we will solely be focusing on chain abstraction across EVM networks ([EVM Chain Abstraction](/introduction/chain-abstraction#evm-chain-abstraction)).
See the [comparison](/introduction/comparison) for more information.
