# Chain Abstraction

## What is Chain Abstraction?

Chain abstraction harmonizes user interaction across multiple networks, dissolving the intricacies of multi-chain engagement into a single, coherent user experience.
By enabling this, users no longer face the cumbersome task of switching networks or authenticating multiple transactions. They are empowered to use any token across any dApp within the supported chains through a unified interface.
This not only streamlines logic implementation across various dApps but also simplifies the user journey by removing the hassle of managing gas fees on alternative chains, setting the stage for effortless and integrated blockchain navigation.

## What does it enable?

Chain Abstraction enables dApps to implement logic across multiple chains.
This innovation eliminates the necessity for users to toggle between networks, authenticate transactions on various chains, or incur gas fees on alternate chains.
Users can now effortlessly engage with your dApp across any supported chain, utilizing any token, all while staying within your user interface.

## EVM Chain Abstraction

:::warning
Lightis currently focusing on EVM Chain Abstraction.
:::

Our protocol specifically targets networks based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Focusing exclusively on EVM-compatible networks allows us to extend our capabilities beyond Ethereum itself, enhancing feature support and ensuring trustless asset security.
This specialized focus on EVM ecosystems allows for optimized interactions, excluding non-EVM networks such as Bitcoin and Solana to ensure a robust and secure experience for EVM-based applications.

For an in-depth understanding of how our protocol stands out in the landscape of chain abstraction, refer to our [comparison](/introduction/comparison) chart for more information.
