# Chain Abstraction

## What is Chain Abstraction?

The concept of chain abstraction is to provider users a way to interact with multiple networks without complexity any friction.
The end goal is for users to not recognize that they are under the hood interacting with a blockchain(s).

Chain Abstraction enables dApps to implement logic across multiple chains. This innovation eliminates the necessity for users to toggle between networks, authenticate transactions on various chains, or incur gas fees on alternate chains. Users can now effortlessly engage with your dApp across any supported chain, utilizing any token, all while staying within your user interface.



## EVM Chain Abstraction

EVM Chain Abstraction is a subset of Chain Abstraction that focuses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based networks.

## Light's Approach

We believe that as of right now, the best way to approach Chain Abstraction is through a VM based approach.
This means that we will solely be focusing on the EVM networks. See the [comparison](/introduction/comparison) for more information.
