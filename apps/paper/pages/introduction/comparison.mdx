# Comparison

There are several solutions that provide a unified interface to interact with multiple blockchains.
This page compares Light with other solutions like NEAR and Particle Network.

:::tip
We are obviously biased towards Light, but we will try to be as objective as possible.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know.
