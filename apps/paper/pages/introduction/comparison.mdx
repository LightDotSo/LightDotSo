# Comparison

In the chain abstraction landscape, Lightoffers distinct advantages:

- **End-to-End Modularity**: Our platform offers a seamless transition from application interfaces to programmable intents, simplifying the development process and enhancing the user experience for both developers and users.
- **Robust SDK**: We equip developers with a comprehensive toolkit for creating and integrating dApps across various EVM chains, promoting innovation and interoperability.
- **EVM-Centric Design**: By focusing on EVM chains, we guarantee broad feature compatibility and secure asset management, ensuring a reliable foundation for transactions.
- **Innovative Gas Relay Network**: Our approach simplifies the user experience by streamlining transaction costs and processes, thanks to our network of competitive gas relayers.
- **LightLayer**: We leverage our custom L2 rollup solution to facilitate and execute cross-chain transactions more efficiently, driven by user-defined intents for smoother, more precise outcomes.
