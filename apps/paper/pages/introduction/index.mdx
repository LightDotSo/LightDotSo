# Introduction

## Why Light

Lightis an EVM chain abstraction protocol designed to unify the Ethereum ecosystem for dApps, developers, and users.
By abstracting the complexities of engaging with multiple networks, our protocol minimizes friction and enables seamless interactions across various chains, aiming for users to experience Ethereum and its related chains as one cohesive network.

## More chains, more problems

Interacting with Ethereum presents significant challenges.
The strategy of horizontally scaling Ethereum through a [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) has led to a fragmented user experience (UX) for both users and developers.
Users often face multiple prompts and transactions to engage with various chainsâ€”a complexity that increases with more chains.
To effectively scale Ethereum, it is essential to provide a unified and straightforward experience across all chains.

## Lights Approach

Our current focus is on EVM chain abstraction, targeting networks based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
This approach allows us to support a broad array of EVM-compatible networks, enhancing our protocol's applicability beyond just Ethereum.
Given the known limitations of current technology, we are committed to a VM-based approach to chain abstraction.
This strategy ensures that our protocol simplifies the user experience across EVM networks, facilitating seamless interactions within any participating dApp's user interface.
