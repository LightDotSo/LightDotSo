# Introduction

## What is Light?

Light is the easiest way to interact with multiple chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.
We abstract away the complexity of interacting, removing away the friction for users to interact with multiple networks as if it is one.
The goal is for users to use Ethereum and related chains of the ecosystem as if it is one single network.

## More chains, more problems

Using Ethereum is hard. Through horizontally scaling Ethereum with [rollup centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), it has led to a fragmented UX for users and developers.
Users have to go through multiple prompts and transactions to interact with multiple chains, and it only gets worse as the number of chains increase.
In order for Ethereum to truly scale, it is crucial for users to an unified experience that is seamless and easy to use across all chains.

## Light's Approach

Our approach is EVM chain abstraction - we aim to provide users a unified experience across all EVM chains, freeing users from the burden and complexity of interacting with multiple chains.
