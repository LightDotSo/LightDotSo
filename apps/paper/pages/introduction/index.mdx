# Introduction

## What is Light?

Light is the easiest way to interact with multiple chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.
We abstract away the complexity of interacting with multiple chains, and provide a simple yet programmable to interact with multiple networks at once.

## More chains, more problems

Using Ethereum is hard. Through horizontally scaling Ethereum with [rollup centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), it has led to a fragmented UX for users and developers.
Users have to go through multiple prompts and transactions to interact with multiple chains, and it only gets worse as the number of chains increase.

## Light's Approach

Our approach is EVM chain abstraction - we aim to provide users a unified experience across all EVM chains, freeing users from the complexity of interacting with multiple chains.j
