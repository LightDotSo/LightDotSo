# Philosophy

## User First

Users should not have to deal with the burden of interacting with multiple chains, they should be able to interact with all as if it is one.

## Maximum Flexibility

User should have the freedom to express the atomicity of cross-chain interactions (optimistic, strict, conditional) rather than being enforced/limited by the rules of underlying network.

## Modularity and Permissionless

Each layer should be modular and permissionless, allowing for the composability of different layers to eventually support a wide range of use-cases.
