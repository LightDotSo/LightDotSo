# Philosophy

## User First

More chains, more problems. Users should not have to worry about the underlying network, they should be able to interact with the network in a seamless way.

## Maximum Flexibility

User should have the freedom to express the atomicity of cross-chain interactions (optimsitic, strict, conditonal) rather than being enforced/limited by the underlying network.
