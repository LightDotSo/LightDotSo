# Philosophy

## User First

We believe users deserve a frictionless experience. Interacting with multiple chains should be as simple as dealing with a single, unified chain.

## Maximum Flexibility

We empower users with the freedom to express the atomicity of cross-chain interactions—be they optimistic, strict, or conditional—rather than conforming to the constraints of the underlying networks.

## Modularity, Open Source & Permissionless

Our commitment to modularity and permissionless design in each layer ensures the freedom to innovate and compose, laying the foundation for diverse applications and use-cases.
