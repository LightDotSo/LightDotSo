## Our Integrated Approach

Lightseamlessly integrates every phase of user interaction, bridging the application interface with the programmable intents layer.
This vertical integration is fundamental to delivering an unparalleled chain abstraction experience to the end-user.

Our [end-to-end solution](/introduction/user-flow)designed to foster the usage and development of each layer of our stack, promoting permissionless innovation and composability. This facilitates the creation of a superior chain abstraction interface, which we provide directly to our end-users.
