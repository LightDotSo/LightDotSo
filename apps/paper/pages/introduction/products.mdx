Light vertically integrates the entire lifecycle of the user interaction, from the application interface to the programmable intents layer in order to provide the best chain abstraction experience for the end user.

Our end-to-end solution aims to bootstrap the usage of each aspect of the layer, enabling permissionless modularization and composability of the different components of the stack, while aiming to offer a best-in-class chain abstraction experience ourselves.

See [Light Smart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet), [Light Gas Abstraction](/light-gas-abstraction), and [Light Programmable Intents](/light-programmable-intents) for more details.

:::tip
We envision to support the long tail of chains through our stack, meaning that the modularization of each layer (which is a key aspect of the Light) is crucial, as an opt-in approach of a different layers enables better flexibility for underlying chains, dapps, and developers.
