Light vertically integrates the entire lifecycle of the user interaction, from the interface to the preferences of the cross-chain transactions in order to provide the best experience for the end user.

Our end-to-end solution aims to bootstrap the usage of each aspect of the layer, enabling permissionless modularization and composability of the different components of the stack.

:::tip
Our priority is to enable support of the long tail of chains, the modularization of the stack (which is a key aspect of the Light), enabling the opt-in approach of a different layers of the chain abstraction stack.
