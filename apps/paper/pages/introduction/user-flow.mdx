# User Flow

The main flow for users interacting with Light is as follows:

1. Users submits an intent/transaction to Light's offchain relayer

2. The relayer bids for the right to subsidize the transaction on the target chain(s)

3a. Users signs one signature to authorize the transaction on the target chain(s)

3b. (Optionally) User can set specific intent/preferences for the transaction to be executed on the target chain(s)

4. The corresponding transactions are relayed to the target chain(s) and executed concurrently through the bundler from a smart account

5. If a specific intent/preferences is set, the transactions are submitted to the target chain(s) at the specified order
