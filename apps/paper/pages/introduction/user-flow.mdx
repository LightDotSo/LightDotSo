# User Flow

## Ideal User Flow

![user-flow](/user-flow.png)

The main flow that we're envisioning for users interacting with Light is as follows:

:::info
Light's goal is to enable cross-chain interactions with minimal number of steps and complexity for users, while having support for all tx formats and chains.
See our [goals](/goals) for more information.

::::steps

### Step 1

Users submits an intent/transaction to Light's offchain [gas network](/light-gas-abstraction)

### Step 2

The relayer bids for the right to subsidize the transaction on the target chain(s)

### Step 3

a. Users signs one signature to authorize the transaction(s) on the corresponding target chains with Light's [cross-chain smart account](/light-smart-wallet)

b. (Optionally) User can set specific intent/preferences for the transaction to be executed on through [programmable intents](/light-programmable-intents)

### Step 4

The corresponding transactions are relayed to the target chain(s) and executed concurrently through the bundler from a smart account

### Step 5

If a specific intent/preferences is set, the transactions are submitted to the target chain(s) at the specified order
