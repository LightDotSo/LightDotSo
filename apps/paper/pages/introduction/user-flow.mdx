# User Flow

## Ideal User Flow

![user-flow](/user-flow.png)

The main flow that we're envisioning for users interacting with Light is as follows:

:::info
Light's goal is to enable cross-chain interactions with minimal number of steps and complexity for users, while having support for all tx formats and chains.
Users should be able to specify their intent, authorize the transaction in one click, and the underlying complexity of cross-chain transactions should be abstracted away.
See our [goals](/goals) for more information.

::::steps

### 1. Intent Submission

Users submits an intent/transaction to Light's [Intent Engine](/light-intent-engine) with the following information:

- Desired outcome
- Source chain (if applicable)
- Destination chain (if applicable)

User can also be prompted set specific intent/preferences for the transaction to be executed on through [programmable intents](/light-programmable-intents)

### 2. Gas Abstraction

Gas sponsorship is routed to Light's offchain [gas network](/light-gas-abstraction) for subsidizing the transactions on the target chain(s).
The relayer bids for the right to subsidize the transactions, so that the user gets the best gas price for their transactions.

### 3. Transaction Authorization

Users signs one signature to authorize the transaction(s) on the corresponding target chains with Light's [cross-chain smart account](/light-smart-wallet), or other types of transaction format through conventional EOAs.

### 4. Programmable Intent Execution

The corresponding transactions are relayed to the target chain(s) along with the programmable intent preferences to the [Light Layer](/features/light-layer).
Off-chain actors bid for the right to execute the transactions, and the winning bidder executes the transactions.
Users benefit from the best execution of their transactions, while getting assured some extent of privacy and security, and also "programmatic atomicity" of their transactions.

### 5. Settlement and Confirmation

The transactions are settled on the target chain(s) and the user is notified of the outcome.
Since cross-chain transactions are inherently asynchronous, the user can track the status of their transactions through our proprietary explorer or other blockchain explorers.
