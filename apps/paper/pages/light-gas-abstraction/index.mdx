# LightGas Abstraction

LightGas Abstraction is a solver-based, permissionless gas relayer network that significantly improves the user experience by enabling payment for gas with any asset across compatible EVM networks, minimizing multi-chain transaction friction.
Additionally, any solver may participate permissionlessly, competing to sponsor gas fees for users.

:::info
Initially operating with a whitelisted set of solvers, the network will evolve towards a fully permissionless model.

## Architecture Overview

Drawing inspiration from intent-based models like [Across](https://across.to), LightGas Abstraction delegates the capital risk of gas abstraction to gas relayers.
These paymasters compete to sponsor users' gas fees, leading to more competitive rates and a broader choice of assets for gas payment.
When integrated with [LightSmart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet), this architecture further simplifies cross-EVM network operations for users.

## Wide-Ranging Compatibility

Our comprehensive approach supports varied transaction types and order flows, optimizing user experience:

- Compatible with EIP-4337 paymasters, EIP-3074, and meta-transactions for gas subsidization
- Complete sponsorship of user order flows is available to drive engagement with dApps
- Off-chain actors bid to sponsor transactions, ensuring optimal and cost-effective gas fee routing

## Sponsorship Scenarios

LightGas Abstraction caters to several sponsorship scenarios, enabling users to have their gas fees sponsored within EVM networks:

### 1. Escrow Gas Sponsorship

Users can have funds escrowed by a paymaster, which are then utilized to cover gas fees, with the paymaster being reimbursed from these escrowed funds.

### 2. Operation Modification for Gas Sponsorship

Paymasters may modify transaction operations to sponsor gas fees, streamlining the process for users by allowing paymasters to directly receive repayment.

### 3. Custom Logic Gas Sponsorship

Custom sponsorship logic allows for tailored gas fee sponsorship, with dApps, chains, or other entities sponsoring gas fees in ways that benefit both users and sponsors.
