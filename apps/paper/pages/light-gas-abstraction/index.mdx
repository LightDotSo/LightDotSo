# Light Gas Abstraction

Light Gas Abstraction is a permissionless, solver based gas relayer network that provides universal gas abstraction for users of any compatible EVM network.
With Light Gas Abstraction, users can pay for gas in any asset across any EVM network, improving the user experience and reducing the friction of using multiple EVM networks.
In addition, the network is designed to be permissionless, allowing any solver to participate in the network and compete to sponsor gas fees for users.

:::info
Initially, the solver network will be gated by a whitelist of approved solvers. Over time, the network will transition to a fully permissionless model.

## Architecture

Similar to intent-based architecture pioneered by [Across](https://across.to), Light Gas Abstraction is designed for the gas relayers to bear the capital risk associated w/ the gas abstraction.
Since the paymaster competes to propose sponsorship of the gas subsidization for a proposed fee, the user benefits with lower fees while having more optionality of which asset to pay gas in.
Combined with the [Light Smart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet), users now have the ability to pay for gas in any asset across any EVM network, improving the user experience and reducing the friction of using multiple EVM networks.

## Compatibility

We take a more holistic approach supporting any kind of orderflow + transaction format, so that the user can have the best experience possible:

- all of 4337 paymaster + 3074 + meta tx can be supported for gas subsidization
- the user's orderflow can be fully sponsored to generate traction for the underlying dapp
- off-chain actors bid to sponsor through OFA, so the gas fee and routing is optimal and low cost

## Sponsorship Scenarios

There are three main sponsorship scenarios in which user could get sponsored for gas payment in a given EVM network.

### 1. Gas Sponsorship through Escrow

Users can approve funds to be escrowed by the paymaster, which will be used to pay for gas fees on their behalf.
The paymaster will then pay the gas fees on behalf of the user and repaid the sponsored gas fees from the escrowed funds.

### 2. Gas Sponsorship through Operation Modification

Paymasters can choose to modify the operation of the transaction to pay for the gas fees on behalf of the user.
This can enable the paymaster to directly receive the sponsored gas fees from the user, leading to a more seamless user experience.

### 3. Gas Sponsorship through Custom Logic

Paymasters can choose to offer custom logic to sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user.
Dapps, chains, and other entities can propose to sponsor gas fees for users in a customized way that benefits both the user and the sponsor.
