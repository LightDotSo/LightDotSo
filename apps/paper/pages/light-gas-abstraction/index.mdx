# Light Gas Abstraction

Light Gas Abstraction is a permissionless, solver based gas relayer network that provides universal gas abstraction for users of any compatible EVM network.

:::info
Initially, the solver network will be gated by a whitelist of approved solvers. Over time, the network will transition to a fully permissionless model.

## Architecture

Similar to intent-based architecture pioneered by [Across](https://across.to), Light Gas Abstraction is designed for the gas relayers to bear the capital risk associated w/ the gas abstraction.
Since the paymaster competes to subsidize the gas for an intended fee, the user benefits.
Combined with the [Light Smart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet/), users now have the ability to pay for gas in any asset across any EVM network, without having to hold the native asset of the network they are transacting on.
