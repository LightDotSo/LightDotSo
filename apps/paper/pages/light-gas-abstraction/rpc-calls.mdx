# RPC Calls

## Paymaster RPC Call

The intended use of this call is to obtain a list of user operations w/ the associated gas limit, paymaster, and fee.
Since the result of this call will result in multiple user operations, the client will need to present the user with a list of sponsorships w/ the approved assets and fees.
