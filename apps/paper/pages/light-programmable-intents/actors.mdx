# Actors in the System

## Overview

There are three main actors in the system:

- [Intent Engine](/features/intent-engine): Responsible for processing the intents and generating the responses to fulfill the user's request.
- [Off-chain Actors](/features/off-chain-actors): Responsible for executing the transactions based on the user's preferences.
- [Light Layer](/features/light-layer): Responsible for settling the cross-chain intent on behalf of the user.
