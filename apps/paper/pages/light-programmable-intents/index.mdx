# Light Programmable Intents

Light Programmable Intents enables users to specify intents, or preferences to enable programmatic asynchronous execution of cross-chain transactions.

Cross-chain transactions are inherently asynchronous and require a dedicated mechanism to ensure that the desired outcome is achieved.
Rather than trying to achieve interoperability through enshrined oracles, sequencers, or other forms of architecture that enables synchronous atomicity between a subset of chains, [Light Programmable Intents](/light-programmable-intents) aims to achieve "Programmable Atomicity", through user-defined preferences or intents across all EVM chains.
This enables users to authorize transactions where off-chain actors fulfill execution, and any form of arbitrary function call on the underlying chains can be executed with regards to user's preferences, and the desired outcome can be achieved with minimal friction as possible.

"Programmable atomicity" is a concept that enables users to define their own [Programmatic Security Mechanism](/light-programmable-intents#programmatic-security-mechanism).

Initially, it will be implemented as a centralized service, but the goal is to decentralize it over time as an EVM compatible L2 that settles on Ethereum.
Our focus is strictly on transaction initiation across all EVM chains, through user defined intents or preferences.

## Programmatic Execution

Since the programmatic intents are user-defined, users can define their own conditional execution logic for N number of chains within EVM bytecode, ensuring that the desired outcome is achieved.
This can range from intents that range from conditional, multi-step, recurring, or any form of arbitrary function call on the underlying chains can be executed with regards to user's preferences.
[Light Layer](/features/light-layer) (L2) will ensure that the desired execution is achieved safely and securely, according to the user's preferences.

## Programmatic Settlement

Off-chain actors take on the capital risk of executing the transaction, they can define the settlement mechanism based on their preferences.
This enables operators to opt-in for a settlement mechanism that suits their risk appetite and on the chain of their choice, and the desired outcome can be achieved with maximum capital efficiency.
These can range from [Optimistic Aggregated and Optimistic Verification](https://docs.across.to/concepts/intents-architecture-in-across), or can be settled on Light Layer (L2) on the actor's preference.

## Programmatic Security Mechanism

Different types of transactions require different types of settlement mechanisms, as the economic stake on the line varies.
As inspired by the [Hyperlane's Modular Security Mechanism](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security), Light Programmable Intents does not enforce a single settlement mechanism, but rather allows users to opt in their own security mechanism based on their preferences.
Users can opt-in for Multi-Sig, Guardians, or any other form of security mechanism that they prefer, enabling them to have far more control over their transactions.
