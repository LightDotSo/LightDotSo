# Light Programmable Intents

Light Programmable Intents enables users to specify intents, or preferences to enable programmatic asynchronous execution of cross-chain transactions.
Support will initially be for EIP-4337 transactions only, and the transactions will be executed inside a trusted execution environment.

Initially, it will be implemented as a centralized service, but the goal is to decentralize it over time as an EVM compatible L2 that settles on Ethereum.
Our focus is strictly on transaction initiation across all EVM chains, through user defined intents or preferences.
