# Intent Engine

## Overview

[Intent Engine](/features/intent-engine) is responsible for processing the intents and generating the responses.
Through the engine, users are able to configure their intents and preferences, and execute the transactions based on the user's preferences.
We outsourced the execution of the transactions to the off-chain actors, who can execute the transactions on behalf of the user, and the desired outcome can be achieved with minimal friction as possible.
