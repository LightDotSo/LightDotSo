# Programmable Intents

## Routing the Intents

[Intent Engine](https://assets.light.so/paper/features/intent-engine) is responsible for processing the intents and generating the responses.
Through the engine, users are able to configure their intents and preferences, and execute the transactions based on the user's preferences.
We route different type of intents to specific off-chain actors, who can then best tailor the steps towards the user in order to fulfill and route the specific intent in order to achieve the desired outcome.

## What are Programmable Intents

Programmable Intents are user-defined intents or preferences that enable programmatic asynchronous execution of cross-chain transactions.
Since cross-chain transactions are inherently asynchronous, they require a dedicated mechanism to ensure that the desired outcome is achieved.
We aim to achieve "Programmable Atomicity" through user-defined preferences or intents across all EVM chains, enabling users to authorize transactions where off-chain actors fulfill execution, and any form of arbitrary function call on the underlying chains can be executed with regards to user's preferences, and the desired outcome can be achieved with minimal friction as possible.

### Programmatic Execution

Since the programmatic intents are user-defined, users can define their own conditional execution logic for any number of chains within EVM bytecode, ensuring that the desired outcome is achieved.
This can range from intents that range from conditional, multi-step, recurring, or any form of arbitrary function call on the underlying chains can be executed with regards to user's preferences.
[Light Layer](https://assets.light.so/paper/features/light-layer) (L2) will ensure that the desired execution is achieved safely and securely, tailored to within the user's preferences.

### Programmatic Security

Different types of transactions require different types of settlement mechanisms, as the economic stake on the line varies.
As inspired by the [Hyperlane's Modular Security Mechanism](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security), Light Layer does not enforce a single settlement mechanism, but rather allows users to opt in their own security mechanism based on their intent preferences.
Users can opt-in for Multi-Sig, Guardians, or any other form of security mechanism that they prefer (which is enshrined in the escrow contract), enabling them to have far more control over their transactions security and cost.

### Programmatic Settlement

Off-chain actors take on the capital risk of executing the transaction, they can define the settlement mechanism based on their preferences.
This enables operators to opt-in for a settlement mechanism that suits their risk appetite and on the chain of their choice, and the desired outcome can be achieved with maximum capital efficiency.
Solver transactions are submitted to the underlying chain and communicated off-chain to enable scalability among the solver nodes, while ensuring that the settlement mechanism will be enforced in a secure and efficient manner.

::::warning
The settlement mechanism is constrained by the user's preferences of the security mechanism enforced in the escrow contract.
