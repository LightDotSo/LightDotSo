# Ecosystem Support

## Overview

Light supports multiple ecosystem initiatives to help with compatibility and align with the broader ecosystem.

## ERC4337 - Account Abstraction

Light is compatible with the ERC4337 standard for account abstraction.
This standard is designed to allow for a common standard for account abstraction on the EVM.
Users will not have to bear the vendor lock-in and can switch between different infrastructure providers with ease.

## ERC7579 - Minimal Modular Smart Accounts

Light is compatible with the ERC7579 standard for minimal modular smart accounts.
This standard is designed to allow for the management of plugins and modules in a smart account.
Light Smart Accounts are compatible with the ERC7579 standard and can be used with any ERC7579 compatible modules.
