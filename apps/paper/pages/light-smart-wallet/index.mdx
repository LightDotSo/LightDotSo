# Light Smart Wallet

Light Smart Wallet is a 4337 compatible [cross-chain smart contract wallet](/concepts/cross-chain-smart-account) that supports state sync & signature aggregation.

:::warning
There is a trust assumption in the current approach of Light's proprietary server storing the keystore configuration of the wallet.
The goal is to remove this trust assumption in the future through the use of a keystore rollup or other decentralized storage solutions.

## Enabling Cross-Chain Interactions

Two key features of Light Smart Wallet are [state sync](/concepts/keystore-management) and [signature aggregation](/concepts/signature-aggregation).
These features enable cross-chain transactions by allowing the wallet to interact with multiple chains, with a single valid signature.
