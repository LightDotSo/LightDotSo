# Light Smart Wallet

Light Smart Wallet is a 4337 compatible [cross-chain smart contract wallet](/concepts/cross-chain-smart-account) that supports state sync & signature aggregation.

:::warning
There is a trust assumption in the current approach of Light's proprietary server storing the keystore configuration of the wallet.
The goal is to remove this trust assumption in the future through the use of a keystore rollup or other decentralized storage solutions.

## Chain Abstracted Smart Wallet

Two key features of Light Smart Wallet are [state sync](/concepts/keystore-management) and [signature aggregation](/concepts/signature-aggregation).
These features enable cross-chain transactions by allowing the wallet to interact with multiple chains, with a single valid signature.
Users can now initiate multi-chain transactions with a single signature, reducing the complexity of cross-chain interactions and improving the user experience.

## One Address, Multiple Chains

Unlike traditional smart contract wallets, Light Smart Wallet enables using a single address across multiple chains under the same keystore configuration.
This is achieved by utilizing [Light State Sync](https://sequence.xyz/blog/sequence-wallet-light-state-sync-full-merkle-wallets)
With a lazy sync approach, our wallet is enable to have support for all EVM compatible chains with little to no additional integration efforts.
