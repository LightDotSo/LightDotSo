# Light Smart Wallet

Light Smart Wallet is a 4337 compatible [cross-chain smart contract wallet](/features/cross-chain-smart-account) that supports state sync & signature aggregation.

:::warning
In its current iteration, Light's approach relies on a proprietary server for storing the wallet's keystore configuration, introducing a trust assumption.
We are actively working towards a future where this reliance is eradicated, favoring keystore rollups or alternative decentralized storage solutions to uphold our commitment to security and autonomy.

## Facilitating Chain Abstraction

Our wallet inherently supports [state sync](/features/keystore-sync) and [signature aggregation](/features/signature-aggregation) - key features that streamline the user's ability to engage in cross-chain transactions.
With just one valid signature, users can effortlessly initiate actions across multiple EVM-compatible chains, simplifying what has traditionally been a complex process.

## One Address, Multiple Chains

Breaking away from the limitations of traditional smart contract wallets, Light Smart Wallet empowers users with a single address that operates across multiple chains.
This capability is achieved through our [Light State Sync](https://sequence.xyz/blog/sequence-wallet-light-state-sync-full-merkle-wallets), employing a lazy sync strategy that extends support to all EVM-compatible chains, thereby reducing the need for extensive integration efforts.
