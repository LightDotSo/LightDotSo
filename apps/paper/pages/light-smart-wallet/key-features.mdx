# Key Features

The Light Smart Wallet is designed for utmost compatibility and adaptability, enhancing chain abstraction and seamlessly integrating with cross-chain intents through [Light Programmable Intents](/light-programmable-intents).
Here's what we facilitate:

## Nonce Programmability

Traditional EOAs are restricted by sequential nonce ordering, but Light Smart Wallet breaks this limitation.
With EIP-4337 compatibility, it introduces programmable nonces, allowing for non-sequential nonce generationâ€”paving the way for smoother cross-chain intent processes.

## Enhanced Intents Compatibility

Unlike traditional EOAs where each transaction requires a separate signature per network, Light Smart Wallet empowers users with signature aggregation.
A single signature can now represent multiple transactions across various networks.
This aggregation is key for cross-chain intents, enabling users to authorize multiple intents in one go, which can be executed programmatically across multiple networks.
