# Key Features

## Design Decisions

Light Smart Wallet is designed to have maximum compatibility and flexibility for the purposes for chain abstraction and better compatibility with cross-chain intents through [Light Programmable Intents](/light-programmable-intents).
Here are some things that we can do:

## Nonce Programmability

In the traditional EOA wallets, nonce is sequential and cannot be programmatically defined.
However, with compatibility with 4337 standard, we can define the nonce programmatically, leading to better compatibility with cross-chain intents.

## Intents Compatibility

In the traditional EOA wallets, signature aggregation is not possible, as each transaction has to be signed individually per network.
With Light Smart Wallet, we can aggregate signatures across multiple networks within a single signature.
This enables better compatibility with cross-chain intents, as users can sign multiple intents that can programmatically be executed across multiple networks.
