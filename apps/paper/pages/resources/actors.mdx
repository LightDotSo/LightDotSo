## Escrow

The Escrow contract is responsible for reimbursing gas relayers (paymasters) for their gas costs, and requires users to approve assets to be used for gas reimbursement.

## Gas Relayers

Gas relayers are responsible for subsidizing gas based on the user's request. As they take on the capital risk of paying for the gas,
they are incentivized to only pay for gas that is likely to be reimbursed by the user, or involves other motives like boosting usage of their own platform.

## Paymasters

Paymasters are handled by the gas relayer that is the smart contract compatible w/ [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard.
