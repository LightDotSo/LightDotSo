# Light Smart Wallet

Light Smart Wallet is a 4337 compatible cross-chain smart contract wallet that achieves state sync & signature aggregation.

:::warning
There is a trust assumption in the current approach of Light's proprietary server storing the keystore configuration of the wallet.
The goal is to remove this trust assumption in the future through the use of a keystore rollup or other decentralized storage solutions.
