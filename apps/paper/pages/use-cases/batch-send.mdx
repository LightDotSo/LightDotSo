Currently, there are various methods for sending ETH across different platforms.
Leveraging [Light Programmable Intents](/light-programmable-intents), we can develop a unified interface for batch sending ETH that automatically routes based on the user's requirements.
This can be further enhanced to be conducted with a single signature utilizing [Light Smart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet).
