# Batch Sending ETH

![batch-send](/batch-send.png)

Currently, there are various methods for sending ETH across different platforms.
Leveraging [LightProgrammable Intents](/light-programmable-intents), we can develop a unified interface for batch sending ETH that automatically routes based on the user's requirements.
This can be further enhanced to be conducted with a single signature utilizing [LightSmart Wallet](/light-smart-wallet).
