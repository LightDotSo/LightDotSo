The transaction graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the causal relationships between transactions in a multi-chain transaction flow. It can be used to conditionally execute transactions based on the results of other transactions, and to ensure that transactions are executed in the correct order to achieve the desired outcome in a multi-chain world.
