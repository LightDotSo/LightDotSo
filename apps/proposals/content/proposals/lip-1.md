### What is a LIP?

Light Improvement Proposal (LIP) is a design document providing information to the Light community, or describing a new feature for light.so or its processes or environment. Each LIP must provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The LIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

### LIP Rationale

LIPs are the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Light Network. The history of a feature's proposal and rationale is preserved in the LIPs, which are maintained as text files in a versioned repository.

## LIP Formats and Templates

LIPs should use concise and specific language and follow the standard LIP template. Include sections for the preamble, abstract, motivation (optional), specification, rationale, security considerations, and reference implementation (optional).

### Linking to External Resources

External resources should be referenced minimally to maintain the LIPâ€™s longevity. Allowed external references include official protocol specifications and finalized standards documents.

### History

The LIP document was derived heavily from the EIP Ethereum Improvement Proposal document. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Any comments about the LIP document should be directed to the LIP editors. The history of the EIP is quoted below from the EIP document for context:

- "This document (EIP) was derived heavily from Bitcoin's BIP-0001written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived fromPython's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use..." \*
