Users looking for the most economical option should choose the cheapest routes. **SAFEST**: Sorting by this criterion emphasizes the safety and reliability of the routes. Routes are ranked based on the safety level of the tools (bridges) used in their steps. Users who prioritize security and want to minimize risks associated with their transactions should choose the safest routes. If two routes have the same safety level, they are further ranked based on their speed.
